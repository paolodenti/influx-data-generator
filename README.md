# InfluxDB data generator

## What is it

It's a simple data generator to fill InfluxDB so you can play with either Influx or Grafana. It generates random points in two measurements (cpu_idle and customer_events) for every second, for the last 24 hours. After the generation is done, application starts to generate random points every second continuously. It adds tags to the data sent to Influx so you have more toys to play with.

It was written to provide an example on mine and [Pawe≈Ç](https://github.com/reverendus)'s lecture on logging in microservices at [JDD2015](http://15.jdd.org.pl).

## Prerequisites

Install node.js and npm:

```
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```

Clone the repo, cd into the directory with `package.json` and run:

```
npm install
```

Alternatively, you could run:

```
npm install influx
```

as it is the only dependency.
Please verify installed influx module version with npm:

```
npm list | grep influx
```

Make sure it is 4.0.1 or higher. If it's lower then the generator **might** not work properly, as the API changed in the influx module.

## Run InfluxDB and Grafana

See [my another repo](https://github.com/lukasz-kaminski/grafana-influxdb-statsd-springboot).

## Run the generator

Hit:

```
nodejs app.js
```

Application will inform you when it's done generating points from the past. That's all.

## Visualise the metrics

Go to Grafana and import the dashboard - you'll find it in this repo. Should work right away.
